# Introducing bpftime: Revolutionizing eBPF Runtime in Userspace for Enhanced Performance and Flexibility

Yusheng Zheng, Tong Yu

In the evolving landscape of system-level programming, Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) has emerged as a cornerstone, transforming how we interact with Linux kernels. However, its potential in kernel space is often hampered by inherent limitations. Enter bpftime: a revolutionary eBPF runtime that operates in userspace, breaking free from these constraints. This blog post delves into bpftime, a high-performance, feature-rich solution designed to optimize and simplify Uprobe and Syscall hook processes. By leveraging advanced techniques like binary rewriting, bpftime not only enhances performance but also ensures efficient and safe hooking capabilities, redefining the eBPF landscape.
