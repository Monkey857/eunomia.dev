# the design and implementation of bpftime

The hook implementation is based on binary rewriting and the underly technique is inspired by:

- Userspace function hook: [frida-gum](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum)
- Syscall hooks: [zpoline: a system call hook mechanism based on binary rewriting](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc23/presentation/yasukata)
