## Userspace AOT Compilation of eBPF for Lightweight Containers

### Overview

In the evolving world of cloud-native applications, IoT, and embedded systems, there's an increasing demand for efficient, secure, and resource-conscious computing solutions. Our project addresses these needs by focusing on the development of a userspace eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) with Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation. This initiative aims to create a lightweight, event-driven computing model that caters to the unique demands of embedded and resource-constrained environments.

The main difference eBPF AOT can bring is that it can help build a verifiable and secure runtime for applications, and it can be lightweight and efficient enough, with a low startup time to run on embedded devices.

Duration and Difficulty Level

- Estimated Time: ~175 hours
- Difficulty Level: Medium
- Mentors: Tong Yu (<yt.xyxx@gmail.com>) Yusheng Zheng (<yunwei356@gmail.com>)

bpftime already have a AOT compiler, we need more work to enable it run on embedded devices or as plugins.

### Goals and Objectives

1. **Develop Userspace eBPF AOT Compilation**: The AOT compiler should be able to work well with helpers, ufuncs maps and other features of eBPF. Currently there is a POC for AOT compiler, but it's not complete and need more work.

You can choose one or two of these goals to work on:

1. **Integration into FaaS Containers**: Seamlessly integrate this technology into Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) lightweight containers, enhancing startup speed and operational efficiency.
2. **Plugin System Implementation**: Design a system allowing eBPF programs to be embedded as plugins in other applications, offering dynamic, optimized functionality.
3. **Run AOT eBPF on embedded devices**: Enable AOT eBPF to run on embedded devices, such as Raspberry Pi, and other IoT devices.

### Prerequisites and Skills Required

- Skills in C/C++ and system-level programming.
- Basic understanding of container technologies and FaaS architectures.
- Familiarity with eBPF concepts and applications.
- Interest in IoT, cloud-native, and embedded systems.

### Expected Outcomes

- A functional userspace eBPF runtime with AOT compilation capabilities.
- Demonstrated integration in FaaS lightweight containers.
- A plugin system enabling the embedding of eBPF programs in various applications.
- Run AOT eBPF on embedded devices.

### Additional Resources

1. The AOT example of bpftime
<https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime/blob/master/.github/workflows/test-aot-cli.yml>
2. The API for vm. <https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime/tree/master/vm/include>
3. Compile it as a standalone lib
<https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime/tree/master/vm/llvm-jit>

If you want to add map support for microcontrollers,  I think you can write a c implementation, compile it and link it with bpftime AOT products. We will provide an example later.

## Add Fuzzer and kernel eBPF test for bpftime to improve compatibility

## Userspace eBPF for Userspace File System

In modern operating systems, `fuse` (Filesystem in Userspace) has become a popular choice, allowing developers to create file systems in user space without modifying kernel code. However, the cost of system calls still exists. This is where `bpftime` can play a role.

bpftime may help:

- reducing the overhead of system calls and enhancing performance
- enable cache for fuse without modifying the kernel
- dynamic adjustment of file system strategies based on performance data
- Add more policy and strategy for fuse

You can explore more possibilities with us:

- Time Cost: ~350 hours
- Difficulty Level: Hard
- Mentors: Yiwei Yang (<yyang363@ucsc.edu>) Yusheng Zheng (<yunwei356@gmail.com>)

### Objectives

1. **Synergistic Optimization Between User and Kernel Space**: Utilize `bpftime` to pre-process file system operations like caching and metadata queries in user space, thereby minimizing system call overhead.
2. **Kernel Bypass Mechanism in User Space**: Develop a kernel bypass mechanism for file systems in user space using eBPF, potentially eliminating the need for invasive changes to user applications.
3. **Dynamic Strategy Adjustment**: Implement a system within `bpftime` to dynamically collect performance data and adjust operational strategies in real-time.
4. **Customization for Specific Workloads**: Enable developers to tailor eBPF programs for diverse application scenarios, optimizing for various workloads.

## User-Space eBPF Security Modules for Comprehensive Security Policies

### Project Overview

bpftime is a user-space eBPF runtime that allows existing eBPF applications to run directly in unprivileged user space, using the same libraries and toolchains, and to obtain trace analysis results. It provides tracing points such as Uprobe and Syscall tracepoint for eBPF, reducing the overhead by about 10 times compared to kernel uprobe, without the need for manual code instrumentation or process restarts. It enables non-intrusive analysis of source code and compilation processes. It can also be combined with DPDK to implement XDP functionality in user-space networking, compatible with kernel XDP. The runtime supports inter-process eBPF maps in user-space shared memory, as well as kernel eBPF maps, allowing seamless operation with the kernel's eBPF infrastructure. It also includes high-performance eBPF LLVM JIT/AOT compilers for multiple architectures.

Linux Security Modules (LSM) is a security framework implemented in the Linux kernel, providing a mechanism for various security policy modules to be inserted into the kernel, enhancing the system's security. LSM is designed to offer an abstraction layer for the Linux operating system to support multiple security policies without changing the core code of the kernel. This design allows system administrators or distributions to choose a security model that fits their security needs, such as SELinux, AppArmor, Smack, etc.

What can LSM be used for?

- Access Control: LSM is most commonly used to implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies, different from the traditional owner-based Access Control (DAC). MAC can control access to resources like files, network ports, and inter-process communication in a fine-grained manner.
- Logging and Auditing: LSM can be used to log and audit sensitive operations on the system, providing detailed log information to help detect and prevent potential security threats.
- Sandboxing and Isolation: By limiting the behavior of programs and the resources they can access, LSM can sandbox applications, reducing the risk of malware or vulnerability exploitation.
- Enhancing Kernel and User-Space Security: LSM allows for additional security checks and restrictions to enhance the security of both the kernel itself and applications running in user-space.
- Limiting Privileged Operations: LSM can limit the operations that even processes with root privileges can perform, reducing the potential harm from misconfigurations by system administrators or malicious software with root access.

With bpftime, we can run eBPF programs in user space, compatible with the kernel, and collaborate with the kernel's eBPF to implement defense. Is it possible to further extend eBPF's security mechanisms and features to user space, allowing user-space eBPF and kernel-space eBPF to work together to implement more powerful and flexible security policies and defense capabilities? Let's call this mechanism USM (Userspace Security Modules or Union Security Modules).

You can explore more possibilities with us:

- Time Cost: ~350 hours
- Difficulty Level: Hard
- Mentors: Yiwei Yang (<yyang363@ucsc.edu>) Yusheng Zheng (<yunwei356@gmail.com>)

### Objectives

1. **USM Framework Design and Implementation**: Architect and implement the USM framework within bpftime, enabling user-space eBPF programs to work alongside kernel-space eBPF LSM programs.
2. **Security Scenario Exploration**: Investigate potential security scenarios where USM can effectively intercept and defend against security threats, using both kernel and user-space eBPF mechanisms.
3. **Continuous Integration and Testing**: Integrate USM testing into the bpftime CI pipeline, conducting regular checks to ensure compatibility and effectiveness of security policies.
4. **Documentation and Community Feedback**: Generate comprehensive documentation on USM's architecture, API, and implementation. Engage with the bpftime community to gather feedback and refine USM.
5. **Security Policy Development and Validation**: Develop and validate security policies that leverage USM, demonstrating its potential in enhancing system security.

### Expected Outcomes

- A fully implemented USM framework within the bpftime environment, allowing for seamless operation with kernel-space eBPF LSM programs and compatible with kernel eBPF toolchains and libraries.
- Integration of USM testing into the bpftime CI pipeline to ensure ongoing compatibility and security efficacy.
- A set of validated security policies showcasing USM's capability to enhance both kernel and user-space security.
- Comprehensive documentation and a feedback loop with the community for continuous improvement of USM.
