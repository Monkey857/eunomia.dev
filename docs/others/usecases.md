#### Scheduler

scx_rustland implements the following callbacks in the eBPF component:

```c
/*
 * Scheduling class declaration.
 */
SEC(".struct_ops.link")
struct sched_ext_ops rustland = {
        .select_cpu             = (void *)rustland_select_cpu,
        .enqueue                = (void *)rustland_enqueue,
        .dispatch               = (void *)rustland_dispatch,
        .running                = (void *)rustland_running,
        .stopping               = (void *)rustland_stopping,
        .update_idle            = (void *)rustland_update_idle,
        .set_cpumask            = (void *)rustland_set_cpumask,
        .cpu_release            = (void *)rustland_cpu_release,
        .init_task              = (void *)rustland_init_task,
        .exit_task              = (void *)rustland_exit_task,
        .init                   = (void *)rustland_init,
        .exit                   = (void *)rustland_exit,
        .flags                  = SCX_OPS_ENQ_LAST | SCX_OPS_KEEP_BUILTIN_IDLE,
        .timeout_ms             = 5000,
        .name                   = "rustland",
};
```
The workflow is the following:

.select_cpu() implements the logic to assign a target CPU to a task that wants to run, typically you have to decide if you want to keep the task on the same CPU or if it needs to be migrated to a different one (for example if the current CPU is busy); if we can find an idle CPU at this stage there’s no reason to call the scheduler, the task can be immediately dispatched here.
```c
s32 BPF_STRUCT_OPS(rustland_select_cpu, struct task_struct *p, s32 prev_cpu,
                   u64 wake_flags)
{
        bool is_idle = false;
        s32 cpu;

        cpu = scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl(p, prev_cpu, wake_flags, &is_idle);
        if (is_idle) {
                /*
                 * Using SCX_DSQ_LOCAL ensures that the task will be executed
                 * directly on the CPU returned by this function.
                 */
                dispatch_task(p, SCX_DSQ_LOCAL, 0, 0);
                __sync_fetch_and_add(&nr_kernel_dispatches, 1);
        }

        return cpu;
}
```
If we can’t find an idle CPU this step will just return the previously used CPU, that can be used as a hint for the user-space scheduler (keeping tasks on the same CPU has multiple benefits, such as reusing hot caches and avoid any kind migration overhead). However this decision is not the final one, the user-space scheduler can decide to move the task to a different CPU if needed.
