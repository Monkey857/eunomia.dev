# Contributing to eunomia-bpf

The eunomia-bpf team encourages community feedback and contributions.
Thank you for your interest in making eunomia-bpd better! There are several
ways you can get involved.

## Look at the issues or help us tese

The best way to get started is to look at the issues. We have a number of open
issues that are tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. If you're interested in working on a fix, leave a comment to let everyone know and to help avoid duplicated effort from others.

Don't know where to start? Feel free to ask questions in the issues, in the [email list](mailto:team@eunomia.dev) or in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jvM73AFdB8), we're happy to help!

## GSOC(Google Summer of Code) or OSPP(Open Source Promotion Plan) Guidelines

Welcome to our Open source events contributor guide! We're excited that you're considering contributing to our project. This guide aims to help you craft a successful proposal that aligns with our organization's goals and expectations.

## Writing a Successful GSoC Proposal

Your proposal is your opportunity to make a strong case for your project idea. All proposals should be submitted through the GSoC website, and the key ideas and designs should be put in the issues from the [idea lists](ideas.md)

Here’s how you can structure it and what it may include:

### Introduction

- **Background**: Introduce yourself. Include your academic background, relevant experience, and any previous open-source contributions.
- **Motivation**: Explain why you are interested in this project and what makes you a suitable candidate.

### Project Description

- **Overview**: Offer a detailed description of your project, including the problem it addresses and its objectives.
- **Technical Details**: Discuss the technologies, tools, and methodologies you plan to use.
- **Innovation**: Highlight any unique approaches or solutions you intend to implement.

### Timeline

- **Schedule**: Outline a week-by-week plan. Include milestones, specific tasks, and deadlines.
- **Flexibility**: Show that you’ve considered potential setbacks and have a plan to accommodate them.

### Contribution and Impact

- **Open Source Contribution**: Explain how your project will benefit the open-source community.
- **Future Work**: Discuss how your project can be expanded or improved upon in the future.

#### Appendices

- **Code Samples/Portfolio**: Include links to any relevant past work, GitHub repositories, or code samples.
- **References**: List any references or resources that support your proposal.

### Additional Tips

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon and explain technical terms.
- **Proofreading**: Ensure your proposal is free from grammatical errors and typos.
- **Feedback**: Seek feedback on your draft from peers, mentors, or community members before submission.

### Getting in Touch

Once you are interested in a project, you can get in touch as soon as possible. You can ask questions about the project, the community, and the application process. You can also discuss your ideas and get feedback from the community. It's recommended to do everything in public, such as in the issues or the Discussions on Github.

- **Communication Channels**: Use our official GSoC communication channels, in the [email list](mailto:team@eunomia.dev) or in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jvM73AFdB8). You can also ask with the GitHub discussions.
- **Mentor Interaction**: Engage with potential mentors early. Discuss your ideas and incorporate their feedback into your proposal.
- **Community Engagement**: Participate in community forums or meetings to better understand our project and culture.
